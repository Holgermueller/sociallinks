# Social links

## Essentially a Link Tree knock off

While endeavoring to create a business around my artistic and writing skills, I created several stores and social media accounts. This created a problem, there was no central location where potential fans and clients could access these widespread accounts. I noticed other artists utilizing Link Tree, or other analagous sites that addressed this problem; however, I didn't feel like paying for a subscription to any of these. Instead, I used my meager web development skills to build my own.
